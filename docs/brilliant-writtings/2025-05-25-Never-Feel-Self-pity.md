In my long life, there are two things I would never do.

在我漫长的一生中，有两件事我绝不会做

The firsty thing is to never feel self-pity.

第一件事就是：永远不要自怜

Life is always accompanied by terrible blows, serious setbacks, unfair encounters, and so on.

人生总会伴随着可怕的打击、严重的挫折、不公平的遭遇等等。

I'm never surprised by humanity.

我永远不会因为人性而感到意外。
